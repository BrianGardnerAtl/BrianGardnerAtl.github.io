        Hello there! My name is Brian Gardner. I'm a software developer with a
        passion for teaching others how to build cool things. I live in
        Savannah, Georgia with my wonderful wife, Carley, and our daughter, Ava
        Grace. We both love to cook for our friends and family, and travel
        around the world.

      <h2 style="clear: both;">Education</h2>
      <p>
        I originally enrolled at Georgia Tech for Aerospace engineering in 2008.
        However, after taking a Matlab course my second year, I decided to
        switch and focus on Computer Science the following semester. I graduated
        with a B.S. in Computer Science with honors from Georgia Tech in 2012.

      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        I've had the great privilege of working at Big Nerd Ranch since I've
        graduated from college. It's an incredibly smart and kind group of
        people who push me to be a better developer and teacher every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work on Android consulting projects, as well as teach the Android
        bootcamps. Through today, I've taught over 500 people how to develop
        Android apps. I truly love teaching others how to build cool things and
        I can't wait to continue for many years to come.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also the coauthor of the fourth edition of the Android Programming
        Guide from Big Nerd Ranch, which published late in 2019. I also help
        write the Advanced Android bootcamp materials.
