        Hello there! My name is Brian Gardner. I'm a software developer with a passion for teaching others how to build cool things. I currently live in Atlanta, Georgia with my wonderful wife, Carley. We both love to cook for our friends and family, and travel around the world.

        This site acts as a place to collect my thoughts and accomplishments. Somewhere for me to nerd out on my ever-growing mechanical keyboard collection, different cocktails I've made, the conferences I've attended, or some of the cool things I'm learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning. If these things pique your interest, then I'd love for you to read some of my posts or reach out to me through the twitter link at the bottom of the page.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I originally enrolled at Georgia Tech for Aerospace engineering in 2008. However, after taking a Matlab course my second year, I decided to switch and focus on Computer Science the following semester. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science with honors from Georgia Tech in 2012.

        Not having my fill of higher-education, I am now enrolled in the online masters program at Georgia Tech with a specialization in machine learning. It's a fantastic program with excellent professors and peers. My expected end date is May 2021.

      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        I've had the great priviledge of working at Big Nerd Ranch since I've graduated from college. It's an incredibly smart and kind group of people who push me to be a better developer and teacher every day.

        I work on Android consulting projects, as well as teach the Android bootcamps. Through today, I've taught over 500 people how to develop Android apps. I truly love teaching others how to build cool things and I can't wait to continue for many years to come.

        I also am an author for some of the Big Nerd Ranch courses. I'm the main author for the Advanced Android bootcamp, and I'm currently working on the next edition of the Android Programming Guide. Creating these materials is difficult but it brings me so much joy to know that they are useful to so many people.
