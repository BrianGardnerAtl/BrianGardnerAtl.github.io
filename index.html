      <p>
        My name is Brian Gardner. I'm an Android developer and instructor
        currently employed by Big Nerd Ranch in Atlanta, Georgia. This is my
        own little space on the vast internet and I'm glad you found it. I love
        all things Android, but I'm also exploring the realms of Machine
        Learning in the Master's degree program at Georgia Tech. I also have a
        love of mechanical keyboards, photography, and drawing, so I may muse on
        those things here as well.

        I love software development as well as teaching others how to develop.
        Using the links in the menu, you can access my blog posts and conference
        talks on various Android things. I'll keep it updated from time to time
        as well as add additional information and topics.

        If you want to reach out to me, you can use the links at the bottom of
        the page. Twitter is probably your best bet for contacting me. Just
        tweet at me or send me a message and I'll get back to you soon!
